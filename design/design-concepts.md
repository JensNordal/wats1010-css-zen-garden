#Design Concepts

Overall concept and/or theme:

My overall concept is to use a fixed photographic background with columns and body text set in translucent containers. 
The left side column will be fixed while the body text will scroll.


How I hope to impact/affect the user:

I hope to impact the user positively by creating a layout that is both visually pleasing and formatted in a way that's 
intuitive and easy to read. Maintaining a fixed side column will keep links within easy reach at all times.
